# ContactsBook

This repository contains an example project for an application procedure.

The project is a contact management application that provides a table displaying a list of all contacts, allows to add new contact details and has a contact detail view to display the data of a currently selected contact.

As a use case, I decided to go for a patient management application and will base design decisions which are not predetermined in the task description on this assumption.
